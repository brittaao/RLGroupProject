## Project Description
This project's aim was to train an agent to play the game of Pong using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. It involved understanding the DQN algorithm, implementing it to solve the CartPole-v1 environment, and then applying it to learn Pong. Through experimentation with hyperparameters and preprocessing techniques, we optimized the agent's performance.

## Pong

## Results
Below, we showcase the progression of our agent's learning across various episodes. Our agent is depicted as the green player. In episode 1, the player exhibits a lack of understanding of the game mechanics. However, by episode 556, significant improvement is evident as the agent demonstrates proficiency in the game, winning rounds against its opponent.
