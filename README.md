## Project Description
This project's aim was to train an agent to play the game of Pong using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. It involved understanding the DQN algorithm, implementing it to solve the CartPole-v1 environment, and then applying it to learn Pong. Through experimentation with hyperparameters and preprocessing techniques, we optimized the agent's performance.
